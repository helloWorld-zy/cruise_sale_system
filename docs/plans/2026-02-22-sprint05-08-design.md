# Sprint 5-8 Plans Design

**Goal:** Provide detailed, TDD-first implementation plans for Sprint 5-8 that mirror Sprint 1 structure and include backend + admin + web + miniapp + CI tasks.

**Scope:** Documentation-only. No code changes.

---

## Structure
- One file per sprint: `docs/plans/2026-02-22-sprint05.md` to `...-sprint08.md`.
- Each plan uses the Sprint 1 template: header, Parts A-E, and task-by-task RED/GREEN/REFACTOR steps.
- Each task includes exact file paths, test code, minimal implementation code, commands, and commit steps.

## Architecture Alignment
- Backend follows handler -> service -> repository -> domain layering.
- Frontend uses Nuxt 4 with Vue 3 Composition API `<script setup lang="ts">`.
- Miniapp uses uni-app with TypeScript and Jest tests.
- CI updates included per sprint to keep coverage and workflow parity.

## Feature Coverage
- Sprint 5: recommendations, calendar, price trends, compare tool.
- Sprint 6: booking enhancements, installments, multi-currency, OCR, passenger quick fill.
- Sprint 7: team booking, pricing, notice PDF, travel checklist.
- Sprint 8: realtime info, alerts, progress tracking, support, weather/port data.

## Output
- Detailed plan docs for Sprint 5-8 with full TDD steps and code samples.
